# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Usage: python3 main.py <path_to_book>

Bookbot takes the text from the book file you pass into the command and counts the total number of words, as well as the number of alphabetic characters (case insensitive) and returns a sorted list of alphabetic characters and the number of times they're found in the text.
